# Fortran CSV Exporter üöÄ

A simple Fortran project to demonstrate how to export 1D arrays of integers and real numbers to a CSV file. This project is a straightforward example of modular programming in Fortran, separating the core functionality from the main program.

## üìÅ Project Structure

* `export_csv.f90`: Contains a Fortran **module** with subroutines for exporting data to a CSV format. This file can be reused in other projects.
* `Test_array.f90`: The main **program** that uses the `export_csv` module to create a sample array, print its contents, and save it to a CSV file.
* `data.csv`: The output file generated by the `Test_array.f90` program. It contains the exported data.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile and Run

This project can be compiled with any standard Fortran compiler, such as `gfortran`.

1.  **Compile the module file:**
    ```bash
    gfortran -c export_csv.f90
    ```

2.  **Compile the main program and link the module object file:**
    ```bash
    gfortran Test_array.f90 export_csv.o -o Test_array
    ```

3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./Test_array
    ```

Upon execution, the program will print "Hello World" and the array values to the console. It will then create or overwrite the `data.csv` file in the same directory. The program will pause until you press `Enter`.

## üìú Code Overview

### `export_csv.f90`

This file defines the `export_csv` module, which contains two subroutines:
* `int_1D_export(file_name, array, dim_array)`: Exports a one-dimensional **integer array** to a CSV file. It writes the data in the format `index, "value"`.
* `real8_1D_export(file_name, array, dim_array)`: Exports a one-dimensional **double-precision real array** to a CSV file.

Both subroutines handle file opening, writing, and closing, with basic error-handling to ensure a smooth operation.

### `Test_array.f90`

This is the main program that serves as a **test case** for the `export_csv` module.
1.  It declares and initializes an integer array named `Tab1` with values from 10 down to 1.
2.  It uses a `do` loop to print the contents of `Tab1` to the console.
3.  It calls the `int_1D_export` subroutine to export the `Tab1` array to `data.csv`.

## üìÑ Example Output (`data.csv`)

The generated `data.csv` file looks like this:

```csv
1,"        10"
2,"         9"
3,"         8"
4,"         7"
5,"         6"
6,"         5"
7,"         4"
8,"         3"
9,"         2"
10,"         1"
```
